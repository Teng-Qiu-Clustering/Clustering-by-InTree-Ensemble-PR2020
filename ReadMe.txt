Run demo.m. This can reproduce the results in Fig.4A for the following two clustering method.

ND-Ward-E(KT): the proposed clustering method published in Pattern Recognition in 2020 (Title: "Enhancing In-Tree-based Clustering via Distance Ensemble and Kernelization" by Qiu and Li)

ND-K: a compared method (Qiu,et al. "Nearest descent, in-tree, and clustering",arXiv:1412.5902v2, 2014.) 

* ND-K is the basis of ND-Ward-E(KT)
