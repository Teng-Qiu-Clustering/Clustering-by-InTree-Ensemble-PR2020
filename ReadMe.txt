Run demo.m (this can reproduce the results in Fig.4 for two clustering method: ND-Ward-E(KT) and ND-K)

ND-Ward-E(KT): the proposed clustering method published in Pattern Recognition (2020)
ND-K: a compared method (Qiu,et al. "Nearest descent, in-tree, and clustering",arXiv:1412.5902v2, 2014.) 
* ND-K is the basis of ND-Ward-E(KT)
